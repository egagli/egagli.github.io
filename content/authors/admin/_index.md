Eric Gagliano is a first year PhD student at the University of Washington and is a member of the Terrain Analysis and Cryosphere Observation (TACO) Lab in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. He is advised by [Dr. David Shean](https://dshean.github.io/) and is currently on an NSF GRFP fellowship. Eric is interested in using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and other remote sensing tools to better understand the cryosphere. In his free time, he likes to volunteer, play dodgeball and gaga ball, hang out with friends, and eat peanut butter chocolate chip cookies. He just made this website and has no clue what he's doing :)
